# Not-Just-Coding-Coding-Quiz
Multiple choice quiz to learning coding & General merriment

One of the best ways to learn new material and information is with the help of a game.
When asked, 97% of mathematicians agree that even the most difficult mathematical concepts are easily tackled when applied to a game.

By that standard anyone could learn any skill regardless of difficulty so long as competition is involved. (And perhaps a bit of humor)

This Coding game is intended to make coding a bit more accessible to beginners thru fun questions about coding and pop culture references.

Meant to test your knowledge of all things coding and pop culture, this game will give you an allotted amount of time and for every incorrect answer the amount of time remaining will decrease... making this a race against the clock as well.

Each question is multiple choice with three possible answers.

When every question is answered or when time has run out the game will end; High score will be able to enter their initials and join the leader board.
